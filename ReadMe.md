# Technical Exercise for Criton.

## React or Javascript Address Lat-Lng Look-Up, using Google Apis

Given a relatively simple task from Criton, I set to creating this with React.
I ran across a strange issue of the screen refreshing, changing the state only
seeming to change the page sometimes and not others.
Sometimes I would change the state and it wouldn't change, then the next time it
would and then shortly there after it would refresh. Sometimes it would simply
just stay as I had intended.

With all these issues arising and no obvious answer from my googling and testing,
I moved back to vanilla JS and found that similar functionality(with slightly less
reusability) was achieved in a much shorter time.
I believe it is simply that my understandings of React need a bit more shine, and
the benefit of controlling all aspects of the program with the vanilla JS.

Thus, it is completed as far as I understand, I'm sure there are better ways
and many refactorings that could improve it. Time and practice, be it in this
language or another will hopefully provide me with the skill as I grow in my
career as a developer.

Any questions, please send them to my email address: benrconway84@gmail.com

If you have the know-how to explain what was going wrong with my React
components I would be glad to hear from you.
